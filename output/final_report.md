## Executive Summary

This report investigates the niche of using Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) for real-time audio processing in web browsers, a promising yet emerging field with growing demand for low-latency audio applications and the advantages of Rust's safety guarantees and WASM's performance.

Our research finds that this niche scores a 7 due to its potential to address growing needs in real-time audio processing, combined with the unique benefits of Rust and WebAssembly. While there are some existing tools, the field is still relatively new and not widely adopted, making it an exciting opportunity for innovation and growth.

The report provides a comprehensive literature review, technical architecture design, and implementation roadmap for a real-time audio processing system using Rust WASM in web browsers. We recommend a microservices-based system architecture with a frontend implemented in Rust WASM for audio processing, a backend consisting of various services like authentication, collaboration, and data storage, and a technology stack that includes Yew, Actix, GraphQL, PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS/EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, and more.

Our findings suggest that this approach can deliver high performance, scalability, security, and reliability for real-time audio processing applications in web browsers. The implementation roadmap outlines a 5-phase plan with user stories, technical tasks, timeline & estimates, risk management, success criteria, and next steps.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The demand for low-latency audio applications, such as video conferencing, online music production, and gaming, is on the rise. However, current solutions often struggle to meet these demands due to performance limitations. Rust WebAssembly (WASM) offers a promising solution by combining Rust's safety guarantees and WASM's performance benefits for real-time audio processing in web browsers.

### 1.2 Objectives
Our objectives are:
1. To investigate the niche of using Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) for real-time audio processing in web browsers, its potential, challenges, and opportunities.
2. To conduct a comprehensive literature review on existing research, tools, and methodologies related to this niche.
3. To design a technical architecture for a real-time audio processing system using Rust WASM in web browsers.
4. To propose an implementation roadmap for building a real-time audio processing application with Rust WebAssembly.

### 1.3 Methodology
This report synthesizes four sources of information: niche analysis, literature review, technical architecture design, and implementation plan. Each source is thoroughly researched, analyzed, integrated, and formatted for a coherent final report.

### 1.4 Scope
The scope of this report includes the investigation, analysis, and design of a real-time audio processing system using Rust WebAssembly in web browsers. The system will focus on audio processing tasks such as analysis, synthesis, and collaboration features.
